A scraping and aggregating package using the CollegeFootballData API


`cfbscrapR` is an R package for working with CFB data. It is an R API wrapper around [https://collegefootballdata.com/](https://collegefootballdata.com/). It provides users the capability to retrieve data from a plethora of endpoints and supplement that data with additional information (Expected Points Added/Win Probability added). 

__Note:__ The API ingests data from ESPN as well as other sources. For details on those source, please go the website linked above. Sometimes there are inconsistencies in the underlying data itself. Please report issues here or to [https://collegefootballdata.com/](https://collegefootballdata.com/). 

## Installation
You can install `cfbscrapR` from [GitHub](https://github.com/saiemgilani/cfbscrapR) with:

``` r
# Then can install using the devtools package from either of the following:
devtools::install_github(repo = "saiemgilani/cfbscrapR")
# or the following (these are the exact same packages):
devtools::install_github(repo = "meysubb/cfbscrapR")
```

For more information on the package and models, please see the `cfbscrapR` [documentation](https://saiemgilani.github.io/cfbscrapR/).
