A scraping and aggregating package using the CollegeFootballData API


`cfbscrapR` is an R package for working with CFB data. It is an R API wrapper around [https://collegefootballdata.com/](https://collegefootballdata.com/). It provides users the capability to retrieve data from a plethora of endpoints and supplement that data with additional information (Expected Points Added/Win Probability added). 

__Note:__ The API ingests data from ESPN as well as other sources. For details on those source, please go the website linked above. Sometimes there are inconsistencies in the underlying data itself. Please report issues here or to [https://collegefootballdata.com/](https://collegefootballdata.com/). 

## Installation
You can install `cfbscrapR` from [GitHub](https://github.com/saiemgilani/cfbscrapR) with:

``` r
# Then can install using the devtools package from either of the following:
devtools::install_github(repo = "saiemgilani/cfbscrapR")
# or the following (these are the exact same packages):
devtools::install_github(repo = "meysubb/cfbscrapR")
```
## Documentation
For more information on the package and function reference, please see the `cfbscrapR` [documentation](https://saiemgilani.github.io/cfbscrapR/).

## Expected Points and Win Probability models
If you would like to learn more about the Expected Points and Win Probability models, please refer to the `cfbscrapR` [tutorials](https://saiemgilani.github.io/cfbscrapR/articles/index.html) or for the code repository where the models are built, [click here](https://github.com/meysubb/cfbscrapR-MISC)

# cfbscrapR v1.0.2
- Remove the [`add_betting_columns()`](https://saiemgilani.github.io/cfbscrapR/reference/add_betting_cols.html) function and the current betting win probability model from the [`cfb_pbp_data()`](https://saiemgilani.github.io/cfbscrapR/reference/cfb_pbp_data.html) function.
- Added [`cfb_ratings_fpi()`](https://saiemgilani.github.io/cfbscrapR/reference/cfb_ratings_fpi.html) function from @sabinanalytics's fork of the repository
- Added the [`cfb_metrics_espn_wp()`](https://saiemgilani.github.io/cfbscrapR/reference/cfb_metrics_espn_wp.html) function, courtesy of @mrcaseb
- Add [tests](https://github.com/saiemgilani/cfbscrapR/tree/master/tests/testthat) for a majority of the functions. This is the biggest behind the scenes change that will translate to more reliable functions. 
- Rename several function outputs from **camelCase to under_score** for consistency. Please adjust your scripts accordingly, apologies for the inconvenience.
- Remove `drives` parameter from [`cfb_pbp_data()`](https://saiemgilani.github.io/cfbscrapR/reference/cfb_pbp_data.html) function. For accessing drives information, please switch to the [`cfb_drives()`](https://saiemgilani.github.io/cfbscrapR/reference/cfb_drives.html) function. 


#### Fix downs turnovers and several other discrepancies in EPA computations.
