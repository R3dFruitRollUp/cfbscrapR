A scraping and aggregating package using the CollegeFootballData API


`cfbscrapR` is an R package for working with CFB data. It is an R API wrapper around [https://collegefootballdata.com/](https://collegefootballdata.com/). It provides users the capability to retrieve data from a plethora of endpoints and supplement that data with additional information (Expected Points Added/Win Probability added). 

__Note:__ The API ingests data from ESPN as well as other sources. For details on those source, please go the website linked above. Sometimes there are inconsistencies in the underlying data itself. Please report issues here or to [https://collegefootballdata.com/](https://collegefootballdata.com/). 

## Installation
You can install `cfbscrapR` from [GitHub](https://github.com/saiemgilani/cfbscrapR) with:

``` r
# Then can install using the devtools package from either of the following:
devtools::install_github(repo = "saiemgilani/cfbscrapR")
# or the following (these are the exact same packages):
devtools::install_github(repo = "meysubb/cfbscrapR")
```
## Documentation
For more information on the package and function reference, please see the `cfbscrapR` [documentation](https://saiemgilani.github.io/cfbscrapR/).

## Expected Points and Win Probability models
If you would like to learn more about the Expected Points and Win Probability models, please refer to the `cfbscrapR` [tutorials](https://saiemgilani.github.io/cfbscrapR/articles/index.html) or for the code repository where the models are built, [click here](https://github.com/meysubb/cfbscrapR-MISC)

# cfbscrapR 1.0.22
- ~~Fix conference parameters to match API (moved to abbreviation format).~~ 
  Removed assertions for now, so users should be able to access conference data without issue, assuming the input argument is correct. May fortune favor your selection. 
- Add mgcv (>= v1.8.32) dependency and update WP model accordingly. Note on WPA: Kickoffs are problematic and our calculation algorithm does not appear to accomplishing what it needs to. We are working on this, aiming for a quick next version update centered around this. 

- Following play type renamings and merging:
  * Pass Interception Return --> Interception Return
  * Pass Interception --> Interception Return
  * Pass Interception Return Touchdown --> Interception Return Touchdown
  * Sack Touchdown --> Fumble Recovery (Opponent) Touchdown
  * Punt Touchdown ~ Punt Return Touchdown. 
  
- Update `rush_vec` and `pass_vec` regex definitions to be more precise on pulling rushing plays.

- Update definition of play_type definition for cleaning "Fumble Recovery (Opponent)" play types to actually distinguish between touchdowns and non-scoring opponent fumble recoveries (prior definition was combining the touchdowns into the non-scoring play type)

- Reduce the reach of the non-explicit rushing/passing touchdowns to be more careful about merging labels.

- Similarly, separated punt touchdowns into a specific type of offensive score where the punting team recovers a fumble and scores, all other `punt touchdowns` prior to this were punt return touchdowns. There is a specific Jalen Reagor (TCU) play where he pulls a Greg Reid and fumbles on the punt return only to recover the fumble and run it in for a 73 yard TD that is explicitly fixed.

- Add the following columns:
  - kickoff_onside
  - kickoff_fair_catch
  - kickoff_downed
  - punt_fair_catch
  - punt_downed
  - sack
  - int
  - int_td
  - completion
  - pass_attempt
  - target
  - pass_td
  - rush_td
  - safety

- add some return skeleton docs
- add column `drive_start_yardline` to the remove cols
- add parsing for kickoff safetys accounting for sign change

- Added [Jared Lee](https://twitter.com/JaredDLee)'s [animated win probability plot vignette](https://saiemgilani.github.io/cfbscrapR/articles/Animated_WP_Plotting.html) to the package documentation page

![Result](https://kazink36.github.io/images/animated_wp_ex.gif)

- Contains important `add_player_cols()` function useful to parse existing play-by-play datasets and pull passer/rusher/receiver/etc. player names. 
  
- Added [Michael Egle](https://twitter.com/deceptivespeed_)'s [4th down tendency plot vignette](https://saiemgilani.github.io/cfbscrapR/articles/fourth_down_plot_tutorial.html) to the package documentation page

## cfbscrapR v1.0.2

- Remove the [`add_betting_columns()`](https://saiemgilani.github.io/cfbscrapR/reference/add_betting_cols.html) function and the current betting win probability model from the [`cfb_pbp_data()`](https://saiemgilani.github.io/cfbscrapR/reference/cfb_pbp_data.html) function.
- Added [`cfb_ratings_fpi()`](https://saiemgilani.github.io/cfbscrapR/reference/cfb_ratings_fpi.html) function from @sabinanalytics's fork of the repository
- Added the [`cfb_metrics_espn_wp()`](https://saiemgilani.github.io/cfbscrapR/reference/cfb_metrics_espn_wp.html) function, courtesy of @mrcaseb
- Add [tests](https://github.com/saiemgilani/cfbscrapR/tree/master/tests/testthat) for a majority of the functions. This is the biggest behind the scenes change that will translate to more reliable functions. 
- Rename several function outputs from **camelCase to under_score** for consistency. Please adjust your scripts accordingly, apologies for the inconvenience.
- Remove `drives` parameter from [`cfb_pbp_data()`](https://saiemgilani.github.io/cfbscrapR/reference/cfb_pbp_data.html) function. For accessing drives information, please switch to the [`cfb_drives()`](https://saiemgilani.github.io/cfbscrapR/reference/cfb_drives.html) function. 


#### Fix downs turnovers and several other discrepancies in EPA computations.
